	abstract = {Airborne laser altimetry (LIDAR – Light Detection and Ranging) is a relatively new method for the acquisition of information of terrain surface. A laser scanning system generates a 3-dimensional clouds of points with irregular spacing. The data consists of the mixture of terrain surface and non-surface points (buildings, vegetation). The separation of ground points from the other points located on top of buildings, vegetation or other objects above ground is one of the major problems. Algorithms and software used for the surface reconstruction have limitations that should be studied and overcome. Removing non – ground points from LIDAR data sets i.e. filtering is still a challenging task. The paper presents a comparative analysis of two filtering methods: FFT based algorithm (a new method investigated at the Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Informatics at the University of Science and Technology in Cracow) and linear prediction method developed at the Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at the Vienna University of Technology . The main purpose of this analysis is to verify FFT based method. FFT based algorithm demonstrate promising results of the terrain surface reconstruction (DTM). However, further investigation is required to verify the reliability and accuracy of filtering algorithm on different types of terrain.},

	abstract="This paper provides a unified discussion of the Delaunay triangulation. Its geometric properties are reviewed and several applications are discussed. Two algorithms are presented for constructing the triangulation over a planar set ofN points. The first algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It runs inO(N logN) time, which is asymptotically optimal. The second algorithm is iterative and requiresO(N2) time in the worst case. However, its average case performance is comparable to that of the first algorithm.",

Experimental evidence presented demonstrates that the modified algorithm performs very well forn≤216, the range of the experiments. It is conjectured that the average number of edges it creates---a good measure of its efficiency---is no more than twice optimal forn less than seven trillion.
