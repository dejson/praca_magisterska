	abstract = {Airborne laser altimetry (LIDAR – Light Detection and Ranging) is a relatively new method for the acquisition of information of terrain surface. A laser scanning system generates a 3-dimensional clouds of points with irregular spacing. The data consists of the mixture of terrain surface and non-surface points (buildings, vegetation). The separation of ground points from the other points located on top of buildings, vegetation or other objects above ground is one of the major problems. Algorithms and software used for the surface reconstruction have limitations that should be studied and overcome. Removing non – ground points from LIDAR data sets i.e. filtering is still a challenging task. The paper presents a comparative analysis of two filtering methods: FFT based algorithm (a new method investigated at the Department of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Informatics at the University of Science and Technology in Cracow) and linear prediction method developed at the Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at the Vienna University of Technology . The main purpose of this analysis is to verify FFT based method. FFT based algorithm demonstrate promising results of the terrain surface reconstruction (DTM). However, further investigation is required to verify the reliability and accuracy of filtering algorithm on different types of terrain.},

	abstract="This paper provides a unified discussion of the Delaunay triangulation. Its geometric properties are reviewed and several applications are discussed. Two algorithms are presented for constructing the triangulation over a planar set ofN points. The first algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It runs inO(N logN) time, which is asymptotically optimal. The second algorithm is iterative and requiresO(N2) time in the worst case. However, its average case performance is comparable to that of the first algorithm.",

    abstract="We evaluated the effectiveness of integrating discrete return light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data with high spatial resolution near-infrared digital imagery for object-based classification of land cover types and dominant tree species. In particular we adopted LiDAR ratio features based on pulse attributes that have not been used in past studies. Object-based classifications were performed first on land cover types, and subsequently on dominant tree species within the area classified as trees. In each classification stage, two different data combinations were examined: LiDAR data integrated with digital imagery or digital imagery only. We created basic image objects and calculated a number of spectral, textural, and LiDAR-based features for each image object. Decision tree analysis was performed and important features were investigated in each classification. In the land cover classification, the overall accuracy was improved to 0.975 when using the object-based method and integrating LiDAR data. The mean height value derived from the LiDAR data was effective in separating ``trees'' and ``lawn'' objects having different height. As for the tree species classification, the overall accuracy was also improved by object-based classification with LiDAR data although it remained up to 0.484 because spectral and textural signatures were similar among tree species. We revealed that the LiDAR ratio features associated with laser penetration proportion were important in the object-based classification as they can distinguish tree species having different canopy density. We concluded that integrating LiDAR data was effective in the object-based classifications of land cover and dominant tree species.",
