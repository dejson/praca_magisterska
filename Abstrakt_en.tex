\chapter*{Abstract}

Two algorithms for surface detection in LiDAR data was presented. By detecting the
surface it is possible to change from cloud point to vector data, therefore decrease
volume of data 100 times. Presenting of such data can be done via Internet. The algorithm
for changing data was presentes, alongside with experiments results.
